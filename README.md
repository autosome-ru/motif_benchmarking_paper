# About
This data repository contains supplementary scripts used to analyse data
for the following benchmarking study:

Giovanna Ambrosini, Ilya Vorontsov, Dmitry Penzar, Romain Groux, Oriol Fornes,
Daria D. Nikolaeva, Benoit Ballester, Jan Grau, Ivo Grosse, Vsevolod Makeev,
Ivan Kulakovskiy, Philipp Bucher. Insights gained from a comprehensive
all-against-all transcription factor binding motif benchmarking study.
Genome Biology 2020.  

Data can be found at [motif_benchmarking_data](https://github.com/autosome-ru/motif_benchmarking_data) repository.

These scripts are not supposed to automate analysis. There were a number of semi-manual stages during data preparation and scripts invocation.
Still we believe it can give a thorough reader better understanding of performed analysis.

It's wise to start repository exploration from `process.sh` and `source_data/process.sh` as they are master-scripts.
